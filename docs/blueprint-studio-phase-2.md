# Blueprint Studio Phase 2

Blueprint Studio Phase 2 converts the Lingo Legacy Creative OS into an operational UI/UX system: asset taxonomy, dashboard modules, studio pipelines, automation rules, and wireframe maps.

## Creative OS source of truth

| Layer | Purpose | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Assets Library | Stores brand, character, world, UI, motion, audio, product, marketing, and tech assets | Versioned creative inventory |
| Blueprint Studio | Turns assets into website, app, game, cinematic, and brand-specific experiences | Production-ready screens and flows |
| Automation Layer | Tags new assets, routes them to studios, generates launch material, and tracks analytics | Repeatable creative operations |
| Production Dashboard | Controls assets, projects, timelines, testing, and publishing | Admin command center |
| Phase 2 Wireframes | Maps screens, menus, buttons, animation triggers, sound cues, and user journeys | Build-ready UX blueprint |

## Asset Library taxonomy

1. `01_BRAND_SYSTEM` — logos, marks, fonts, color tokens, taglines, intro animations
2. `02_CHARACTER_DATABASE` — character sheets, 3D/2D models, expressions, outfits, voices, animation sets
3. `03_WORLD_BUILDING` — backgrounds, locations, maps, props, effects, environment sounds
4. `04_UI_UX_LIBRARY` — buttons, icons, menus, cards, HUD elements, loading screens
5. `05_MOTION_LIBRARY` — logo reveals, page transitions, character animation, reward effects, event animation
6. `06_AUDIO_LIBRARY` — theme music, background music, SFX, voice lines, notification sounds
7. `07_PRODUCT_ASSETS` — apparel, books, merchandise, store images, packaging
8. `08_MARKETING_ENGINE` — trailers, social posts, ads, posters, campaign templates
9. `09_TECH_ASSETS` — code components, API connections, Firebase config, animation components, deployment files

## Production Dashboard modules

| Module | Primary controls | Phase 2 screens |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Assets | Upload, tag, version, approve, publish | Asset vault, detail drawer, approval queue |
| Projects | Website, app, game, cinematic, commerce, brand studio workspaces | Project board, studio status, dependency map |
| Timeline | Sprints, milestones, release windows, event drops | Calendar, kanban, release checklist |
| Testing | QA notes, performance checks, feedback, accessibility review | QA board, issue detail, pass/fail gates |
| Publishing | Web deploys, app store readiness, social posts, commerce drops | Publish center, launch checklist, rollout log |

## Studio pipelines

- Website Studio: homepage, portals, landing pages, store pages, member dashboard
- App Studio: splash, login, profile, dashboard, rewards, store, settings
- Game Studio: concept → character → environment → gameplay → animation → sound → testing → launch
- Cinematic Studio: scene → camera → lighting → animation → voice → sound → final render
- Brand Studios: That’s My Lingo, Kotton’s Code, Loyalty Lane, Obsidian Closet

## Phase 2 wireframe checklist

Every screen should define:

- Entry path and exit path
- Primary CTA and secondary CTA
- Required assets from the library
- Animation trigger and fallback static state
- Sound cue and mute-safe behavior
- Analytics event name
- QA acceptance criteria
- Publishing destination

## Automation flow

`Asset Added → Auto-Tag → Stored → Available Everywhere → Marketing Generated → Analytics Tracked`
